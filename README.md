# Task-Scheduling-Algorithm-for-Enhanced-Energy-Efficiency-on-Multi-Core-Embedded-Platforms  
This codebase is a part of the research paper by the name "Task-Scheduling-Algorithm-for-Enhanced-Energy-Efficiency-on-Multi-Core-Embedded-Platforms"  
All the verilog files and testbenches used for simulation have been uploaded  
The proposed algorithm has two parts  
### Frequency Assignment  
  The file FrequencyAssignment.v contains the FA algorithm  
### Task Assignment  
  The file task_assignment.v contains the TA algorithm  
### Task Scheduler  
  The FA and TA are intergrated into the TaskSchedulter.v file and the TaskScheduler_tb is the testbech used.    
### Other files  
  The other files uploaded are the other algorithm discussed in the paper.
